1\. Code + data = more                                    manageable projects

2\. Get a sense of when and why to use R

3\. Find our way around R and RStudio

4\. Hands-on: common data analysis tasks in R

--

5\. Use R to make data analysis projects manageable

# The plan

Motivation: introducing the case study

Manageable data analysis projects

A gentle intro to R

Dissecting the case study: tools & practices

After we part

???

The case study will provide an overview of the core components of the R toolkit:

- writing code
- loading and analysing data
- visualising data
- blending code and text into automated outputs
- organising the project

We don't start with teaching you the syntax and usage of R:

- so we don't get bogged down in detail
- so you understand useful bits in use in the case study (tidyverse)

By the end of today, you won't necessarily understand every line or be able to create it, but you will understand what are the different tools that are needed to build a project like this and where to learn to use them in more depth.

Output

- text and code
- output: all in one 
- numbers are update automatically

Directory:
- Rmd source
- input data

Together, these allow you to run what I call manageable projects.

Only do valuable work

nor your future self or your colleagues

and so that you can be sure the results are right.

.pull-left[

## What a good project should be like

- automated
- transparent
- easily tweaked
- easily repeated
- low friction
- (easy to collaborate on in parallel or in sequence)
- (clear history of changes)

]

--

.pull-right[

## What it means in practice

- code + data
- self-contained
- documented
- well organised (code, files, workflow)
- code + text
- (version control)

]

---
class: medium, middle, center

ad-hoc calculation

...

**repeatable/automated report**

reproducible report

...

production data system

???

-There is a spectrum
-There are nuances - replication, repetition, reproducible, automated

In different contexts, you will want different standards, but having at least basic reproducibility (i.e. the code will work if someone else runs in order) is good even for the most basic mini projects.

Versus Python?

By statistitians, for data

Community = inclusive, ppl. w/varied backgrounds, non-programmers

Versatile: I show you tabular and spatial data, but you can work with anything.

Very good for any kind of modeling.

Used in critical and high-profile applications (science, newsrooms, industry, government).

### Input data is not altered by code

Data are read from a file into the R environmet.

We use code to operate on the data in the environment, not on the data file.

The result can be written into a new file as needed.

### Everything I do to the data must be recorded in code

No manual editing of the input data files.

No manual editing of output files (only at the end if needed)

The code file should run from start to finish without errors.

### What is in the Environment does not persist

Once R is restarted, it disappears (restart often!)

If you want to keep it, you must have a way of reproducing it with code.

Following these principles will make your data work more reproducible.

These also apply to data analysis in  other languages (Python, Julia aj.)

# Tidyverse: what it is

- built for tabular data (rows and columns)
- grammar analogy: a set of verbs for each type of tasks
- follows logic of data analysis
- can be thought of as extension or dialect of R

## Good practice and discipline

- [naming things](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~rcs46/lectures_2015/01-markdown-git/slides/naming-slides/naming-slides.pdf) consistently (files, objects, columns)
- make project self-contained
- file organisation
- DRY: do not repeat yourself; reuse code by creating functions
- documenting code + files (comments, README.md)
- consistent coding style

See [this post too](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~rcs46/lectures_2015/01-markdown-git/slides/naming-slides/naming-slides.pdf) and my [personal set of practices I try to follow](https://petrbouchal.xyz/rcode/).
